| “I enjoy building and flying model airplanes, and excessive wind can be a problem, especially for lighter models. A flying buddy brought a simple handheld anemometer to our field, and we found it useful to evaluate flying conditions, and to determine how much wind was too much for a particular model."  	| Device is simple to operate        |
|  | Readings are consistent and accurate (explicit) |
|  | Device has multiple functionalities (explicit) |
| “This wind meter is packed with features, and you can easily switch between different units of measure. I’ll be using this for several applications; out kayaking to know when it is safe, on the range to compensate for long range shots, and to determine if conditions are good enough to fly a drone." | Device has many functionalities. (explicit)|
|  | Size of device is compact, making it easy to carry. (explicit) |
|  | Readings from device are made easier to see with backlit display; use at night, dark places and bright areas are possible. (latent) |
| "I do all the maintenance and work on my home heat pump system, and I needed a way to check my system's airflow. My air handler is just in a closet with no duct work on the return, so measuring static pressure with pitot tubes is not feasible. I got this to get some idea of the total airflow of the system, and I can also use it to check each vent to make sure everything is running smoothly. You can specify the approximate area of your return or duct and it will calculate the CFM for you, unlike most of the cheap anemometers available." | Device offers a feature that more affordable alternatives do not offer (explicit) |
|  | Device offers a means to digitally graph readings through provided software. (explicit) |
|  | Use of device in the context of air vents is possible through the backlit screen the device has. (latent) |

|  | Power system of device needs to be up-to-date and interchangeable between batteries and other possible ways to power it. (latent) |
| "It does not come with batteries and that the units reset every time you power it off. It's the work of seconds to get it back to knots or miles per hour or whatever, but it would be nice if it remembered my settings from use to use." | Batteries ought to be provided for device or maybe include rechargeable batteries for the power system. (latent) |
|  | User input for settings ought to be saved upon power down for ease of use. (explicit) |
|  | Simpler ways to switch units for readings are worth looking into. (latent) |
| "I got it to play with and had in mind that I would use it to supplement my weather station to track my weather. But because does not appear to remember reading when not connected to a computer, and since it turns off after 10min (this is good feature, just not for my intended purpose) this will remain in my tool library to be used when needed and not an every day item.” | Device could benefit from having the ability to calibrate it. (explicit) |
|  | Device electronics should be protected from moisture as much as possible. (explicit) |
|  | Auto-shutoff features should be configurable within the device. (latent) |

| “Lost my company supplied one within my first week of work and was not trusted with another so had to get my own. And I mean, now I have my own personal kestrel but its expensive so don't lose it if your company supplies you with only one. Works well, though if holding two side by side I've found that they may show different readings which can be a pain for pesticide application when you are either just over or just under a legal limit factor.” | Device should be affordable. (latent) |
|  | Readings of device should be precise, consistent, and steady enough to prevent confusion when readings reach a desired limit. (explicit) |
|  | Device should employ a method to clip or attach it to something for carrying purposes to reduce likelihood of losing it. (latent) |
|  | Device should have a way to calibrate it to compare and contrast with other alternatives. (latent) |
| “I use this for monitoring heat stress levels at work and it works great and is very reliable. It's quite sensitive even to body heat/humidity so make sure you're holding it as far away from you as you can. Easy to use.” | Device should have safeguards in place to prevent picking up noise from readings while in use. (explicit) |

| “The screen has no 'on' or 'off' button; just the settings buttons, so I've toggled them to turn it on. It only stays on for but a moment which means you have to keep toggling while you're reading it.”| The product must include basic features of an electronic device that all users will expect. (Explicit) |
|  | The product must not attempt to prevent the user from using it for their desired purpose. (latent) |
| “Erratic in displaying outside temperature and time. It appears to be searching for a signal though outdoor sensor is only twenty feet away and all with good batteries.

|  | Needs to be compact (explicit). |
|  | Needs to be able to be mounted (latent). |
|  | The display needs to be easy to read (explicit). |
| “What I like: The size and accuracy. The fact that it takes AA instead of AAA batteries, especially in the sending outdoor unit. It goes a lot longer without having to put in new batteries. Also, It works right away after putting in the new batteries. Other brands I've used require reprogramming on the sending unit. If you use this in your bedroom it does have a few different brightness ranges you can set. Note: It's an AC plug-in home base unit with a AA battery backup. Some people will not like this fact.” | The device needs to be sized to fit in your hand (explicit) |
|  | The sensor data needs to be accurate (explicit) |
|  | Needs to have a long battery life (explicit) |
|  | Needs to have adjustable brightness settings (explicit). |

| “What I'd change: I'd rather have the indoor temperature & humidity be larger like the outdoor reading is, and the time & date be smaller and take up less space on the screen. I didn't buy this to see what time/date it is.” | Data readings need to be easy to read (explicit) |
|  | Device display needs to be focused on its purpose with minimal other distractions (explicit). |
| “I've had this weather station in use for four months. Already the remote sensor has required new batteries three times and just died again. I won't be replacing batteries this time. We will use the unit for internal data only. I know it isn't a costly piece of technology but it's too bad we couldn't have gotten at least a year out of it. Also, the temperature data from the remote sensor was always between five and eight degrees higher than actual temperature.” | The device needs to draw minimal power to extend battery life (latent). |
|  | Needs a manual adjuster to calibrate sensors (latent) |
| “A weather station that stops working when it rains! I've had this piece of junk for ten days now, and it's rained three times since it arrived (on October 19): one day last week, Monday of this week, and today (Friday). All three times, the outdoor temperature and humidity displays show only dashes until an hour or two after the rain stopped. The temp reads accurately when it's working; when it rains, though, this thing is just a useless piece of plastic. It's trash.” | Device needs to be weatherproof and well sealed (explicit) |
|  | Device needs to be durable and long lasting (explicit) |

| “The product is slow to adjust to changes in the house and outdoor. Example: When I first got the product up and running, it took the master unit that runs off of AC power over 1 day to come down on its humidity to what the other three sensors showed It took the outdoor sensor over 4 hours to come down from the inside temp to what the outside temp was at that point.
