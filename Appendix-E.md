<h1>Appendix E - MQTT Topic Table & Code</h1>

Since the device has the capability to access the internet via Wi-Fi, it would be able to utilize an MQTT server for our purposes. To effectively transmit and receive information between the PIC microcontroller and the server, topics would need to be implemented. Using this table, the team was able to organize the information going in and out between the PIC and the server.

This project would not have been able to run at all had it not been for the code that operated every subsystem involved. There were two sets of code involved for this project: the code running the PIC and the code running the ESP32.

Here is the code running the PIC:
