# Team Organization

### Establishing the Team

Upon establishing our team, we began discussing what our individual expectations were for this project. We immediately agreed that we wanted our design to stand out above the rest of the groups in both sections. With that in mind, we began forming goals that would help us develop our current knowledge and be successful in or primary objective. First, we want to create a final product that is a functioning and independent device that can perform in the Innovation Showcase. Second, we want to utilize and develop each team member’s knowledge and skills in embedded systems design. Third, we want to obtain a greater understanding of serial protocol communication, the different types of serial protocols available, and how they can function in unison within the application of our product. Fourth, we want to create a robust and reliable electrical design that is as close to a sellable product as possible. Fifth, we want to design and build a product that we can add to each of our resumes.

After establishing these goals, we developed the following Team Charter and Mission Statement: 

&nbsp;

### Charter


> *“Our team will work together to harness each of our collective abilities and experience to bring a robust and reliable product to the Innovation Showcase that we are proud of, can attract interest from viewers and employers, and can be worthy enough of recognition to add to our own resumes.”*  

&nbsp;

### Product Mission Statement

> *“To leverage each of our team member’s areas of expertise to design and build a reliable, attractive, and functional weather station with a small form factor. The product will solve a real world environmental problem using sensors and actuators. Our product will be similar in quality to commercially available, professionally designed products.”*
