# User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements

Our team employed a comprehensive methodology to identify and prioritize user needs for our product. We first examined reviews of similar products and observed the pros and cons of existing products to gain a deeper understanding of what customers liked and didn't like. This information was then translated into a list of needs for our product. In order to effectively organize and prioritize these needs, we assigned them to five categories: Mechanical, Electronic, Software, Back End, and Other. This categorization allowed for clear and efficient communication and reasoning within our team as we worked to order the needs by priority. The importance of each need was determined through a collaborative process, where the team discussed and assigned weights to the needs based on their perceived impact on the overall user experience.  

Our team extracted meaning from the user needs by carefully analyzing the information gathered from reviews of similar products and observing the pros and cons of existing products. This allowed us to identify the key features and functionality that customers valued in similar products. We then translated these user needs into a list of product requirements that would ensure that our product met each of the most important user needs. To ensure that our product met these requirements, we prioritized the most important user needs and assigned them a specific requirement for our product. This process involved breaking down the user needs into smaller, more specific components and outlining the necessary steps to meet each one. Additionally, we continuously reviewed and refined the list of requirements throughout the development process to ensure that they remained aligned with the evolving needs of our target market.  

Our team will assess our product with respect to each of the requirements we have set forth for ourselves through a thorough evaluation process at each step of the design phase. This will involve reviewing the product aspects against the requirements to ensure that they are being met. Additionally, we will conduct testing and validation of the product to ensure that it meets the critical requirements. This can include functional testing, usability testing, and performance testing, among others. Furthermore, we will regularly review the requirements and compare them against the current design to ensure that we are on track to meet the goals. The product will be continuously evaluated and refined until it meets all of the requirements and provides a positive user experience. We will also consider feedback from beta testers and customers to make any necessary adjustments.
