## Team Organization

### Establishing the Team

Upon establishing our team, we began discussing what our individual expectations were for this project. We immediately agreed that we wanted our design to stand out above the rest of the groups in both sections. With that in mind, we began forming goals that would help us develop our current knowledge and be successful in or primary objective. First, we want to create a final product that is a functioning and independent device that can perform in the Innovation Showcase. Second, we want to utilize and develop each team member’s knowledge and skills in embedded systems design. Third, we want to obtain a greater understanding of serial protocol communication, the different types of serial protocols available, and how they can function in unison within the application of our product. Fourth, we want to create a robust and reliable electrical design that is as close to a sellable product as possible. Fifth, we want to design and build a product that we can add to each of our resumes.

After establishing these goals, we developed the following Team Charter and Mission Statement: 

&nbsp;

### Charter

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements

### Introduction

Portable weather stations are used in a wide variety of applications. Some use them for personal applications such as in residential homes and farmlands to predict weather conditions. Others use them for more critical applications such as emergency responders conducting hazard analysis to run more accurate tests on the weather to guide them in decisions regarding public safety. These devices are in high demand and are always in need of being improved while minimizing the cost for both personal and emergency applications. Users describe difficulty with the longevity of the batteries, the accuracy of sensors, the range of applications, and the wireless connectivity of devices.   

&nbsp;

### Objectives

The aim for this project is to design and build a reliable, attractive, and functional weather station with a small form factor. The product will be similar in quality to commercially available, professionally designed products and that are financially available for all users. The product will solve real world environmental problems while improving on the accuracy and range of serial sensors such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed sensors. As a team, the objective is to create a mobile weather station that stands out against the other project teams and competes with the devices currently available. Our main competitors will be the handheld anemometer by Intendvision, the Kestrel 3000 pocket weather meter, the HODIK weather station, the La Crosse Personal Weather Station, and the Netatmo weather station. Based on the user feedback from the devices of our competitors, we will aim to increase the longevity of the battery life of these devices, the accuracy of the temperature and other serial sensors, integrate more sensing options, and improve the wireless connection between devices.

&nbsp;

### Use Cases

We envision our product being used by everyday people with an interest in the weather, such as the people described in the following stories.

#### **John**
> John is a 68-year-old man who has a small garden in his backyard where he grows vegetables. He has been gardening for many years and takes great pride in his crops. However, in recent years, he has been facing a problem with weather events destroying his plants. He would often come home to find his garden flooded or his plants wilted due to extreme heat. Determined to save his crops, John decided to invest in a weather station. The weather station senses and reports weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. With this information, John is able to take the necessary precautions to protect his garden from the elements. He sets up a watering system to protect his plants from the heat and a drainage system to prevent flooding. He also sets up a small greenhouse to protect his plants from frost. Thanks to the weather station, John is able to save his crops and continue enjoying the fruits of his labor.  
#### **Samantha** 
> Samantha is a 12-year-old girl who has always been fascinated by the weather. She would often spend her free time pretending to be a news weather anchor, giving forecasts to her family and friends. However, her pretend forecasts were based on guesses rather than actual data. She always wished she had some real equipment to help her understand the weather better. For her birthday one year, Samantha's parents surprised her with a weather station. The weather station can sense temperature and precipitation, and it was just what she needed to start her own weather observations. She set it up in the backyard and started tracking the weather patterns in her area. The data she collected was fascinating and helped her to understand the weather better. This made her even more determined to study to become a meteorologist. She would spend hours studying the data and learning more about the atmosphere. The weather station was her first step in becoming a real meteorologist, and she was so excited to see where it would take her.  

#### **Keith**
> Keith is an avid hunter. His favorite game to hunt is Elk. He typically goes up to Coconino National Forest to hunt some. However, he has noticed that the online weather results are not nearly as accurate as they claim to be. He did some research and found the Weather Station by Team 304 and was immediately impressed. He is able to set up several devices due to their affordability. They are light and compact so he can bring many out to the large area he hunts in, without weighing him down. But most importantly, he is able to get much more accurate local weather data, which is pivotal for his big game hunt.

In order to effectively organize and prioritize these needs, we assigned them to five categories: Mechanical, Electronic, Software, Back End, and Other. This categorization allowed for clear and efficient communication and reasoning within our team as we worked to rank the needs by priority. The importance of each need was determined through a collaborative process on [**this Google Jamboard**](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1In28mVD_horjKMaDQrNpOpYlQ2rOk_49XHPvBdQrUTo/edit?usp=sharing), where the team discussed over voice chat and assigned weights to the needs based on their perceived impact on the overall user experience. Screenshots of each step of this process can be found in [Appendix B](./Appendix-B.md).

&nbsp;

### Aspects 
We then extracted meaning from the user needs by carefully analyzing the information gathered from reviews of similar products and observing the pros and cons of existing products. This allowed us to identify the key features and functionality that customers valued in similar products. We then translated these user needs into a list of product requirements that would ensure that our product met each of the most important user needs. To ensure that our product met these requirements, we prioritized the most important user needs and assigned them a specific requirement for our product. This process involved breaking down the user needs into smaller, more specific components and outlining the necessary steps to meet each one. Additionally, we continuously reviewed and refined the list of requirements throughout the development process to ensure that they remained aligned with the evolving needs of our target market.

## Design Ideation

### Brainstorming Ideas

For our brainstorming, we decided to come up with 100 ideas by dedicating 4 frames on Jamboard, one for each team member. Each team member would think up 25 ideas, place them on sticky notes on their dedicated frame, and use a different color to serve as a visual aid for the next step. Here are the 4 frames we ended up with:

![Sorry you're blind!](./images/design-ideation-images/image9.png "Design Ideation Image 9")
![Sorry you're blind!](./images/design-ideation-images/image6.png "Design Ideation Image 6")
![Sorry you're blind!](./images/design-ideation-images/image10.png "Design Ideation Image 10")
![Sorry you're blind!](./images/design-ideation-images/image7.png "Design Ideation Image 7")

### Grouped and Sorted Ideas

Once all of our ideas were created, we then sorted them according to the 3 design sketches our team made. We rearranged our Jamboard to have 3 frames, one for each design sketch and placed our ideas into the frames of which sketch they described. For the sake of completeness and posterity, we added a fourth frame to hold any unused ideas that didn't fit in any of the 3 frames mentioned. Here are what those frames looked like:

![Sorry you're blind!](./images/design-ideation-images/image3.png "Design Ideation Image 3")
![Sorry you're blind!](./images/design-ideation-images/image1.png "Design Ideation Image 1")
![Sorry you're blind!](./images/design-ideation-images/image8.png "Design Ideation Image 8")
![Sorry you're blind!](./images/design-ideation-images/image5.png "Design Ideation Image 5")

### Product Concept Sketch #1 - Dynamic Remote Weather Station

![Sorry you're blind!](./images/design-ideation-images/image11.png "Design Ideation Image 11")

Our first design concept comes in a small handheld device that can be designed to work in-hand or when placed in a particular spot. The shape of the design makes it simpler to place on a desired surface. The sensors, temperature and humidity, would be available to use for data collection. A fan in the device would be activated when the temperature sensor read above a certain threshold to aid in cooling the device's internals. An interesting feature of this concept involves doubling the sensors and placing the redundant pair on the opposite side of the device. This redundancy would allow the device to account for small deviations in its readings to display and transmit more accurate data. The device would have a USB port that would serve as both a charge port and data port. A display would be used to show readings with a potentiometer and a couple of buttons to operate the device. 

### Product Concept Sketch #2 - Handheld Weather Station

![Sorry you're blind!](./images/design-ideation-images/image2.jpg "Design Ideation Image 2")

For the second concept, a hilt-like handheld device was considered. With folding arms having a temperature sensor on one arm and a humidity sensor on the other. It would be a compact and traveler-friendly design. A loop at the bottom of the device would allow for it to be clipped onto something for carrying purposes. The arms of the device would dictate which of the two sensors would be in use at that time. If both arms were to be extended during use, the device would obtain readings from both sensors on their respective arm. The fan in the center of the device would always be available to use, serving both as a sensor for wind speed and as a method to recharge the batteries of the device while in use. Units and sensors could be toggled and data would be capable of being transmitted to another device via wi-fi while also being shown on the device's backlit display.

### Product Concept Sketch #3 - Automatic Plant Hydrator

![Sorry you're blind!](./images/design-ideation-images/image12.jpg "Design Ideation Image 12")
![Sorry you're blind!](./images/design-ideation-images/image4.jpg "Design Ideation Image 4")

Our third design concept revolved around solving a problem that plant owners sometimes encounter: Keeping a plant hydrated while away. This design would seek to measure the humidity level of the soil and the ambient temperature. When the humidity drops or the temperature becomes too high, an actuator would be triggered to dispense water and hydrate the plant. The plant owner would be able to remotely monitor the humidity and temperature and view how much water had been dispensed. The design would be powered by a wall adapter for simplicity and reliability.
