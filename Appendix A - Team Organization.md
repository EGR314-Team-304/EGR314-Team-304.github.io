### Communication Procedures

We plan to communicate primarily through Discord. In this way, we would be able to push multiple targeted notifications to each other and increase productivity and efficiency in communication using the tools available in this communication channel. Synchronous communication is also possible via voice channels if more synchronized or immediate feedback is necessary. Text, Canvas, and email are limited in utility. Text is more easily accessed and lacks the tools available in Discord, but it would suffice. Canvas and email would be a last resort for sending messages to members in worst case scenarios where messages from the other two channels are inaccessible.  

Correspondence with the instructor will be prioritized in person with correspondence via email being next in terms of priority. For any matter that our team needs to communicate, we will discuss who would be responsible for that correspondence for that given matter either in person or using one the three provided channels of communication.
